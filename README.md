# Training

Before training, there are a few steps.

- Step1: Generate reference images (for use image modality during training)

  ```bash
  python generate_data.py --label nudity
  ```

- Step2: Train the model with LoRA weight initialization

  ```bash
  python main.py \
  --modality text \
  --train_method full \
  --prompt tench \
  --devices 0,1 \
  --ckpt_path CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4 \
  --forget_image_path FORGET_IMAGE_PATH \
  --retain_image_path RETAIN_IMAGE_PATH \
  --iterations 1000 \
  --save_iter 100 \
  --lora_init_method fisher \
  --lora_init_prompt tench \
  --lora_rank LORA_RANK \
  --lr LR
  ```
